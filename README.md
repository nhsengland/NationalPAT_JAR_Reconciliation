# National PAT - JAR Reconciliation - South West
## NHS England South West Intelligence and Insights

### What is the JAR/Activity and Planning Summary Report?

The FY25/26 Activity and Planning Summary Report provides an analysis of delivered activity by activity type together with trend information to assess changes in activity through time based on FY25/26 planning definitions. The report has been developed to allow the focus of the report to be switched between differing commissioning and provider responsibilities and geographies using the interactive functionality.

### Scripts

#### Provider Focus
📝 National JAR methodology - Accident and Emergency Attendance script - Provider  
📝 National JAR methodology - Admitted patient care script - Provider  
📝 National JAR methodology - Outpatient Attendance script - Provider  
📝 National JAR methodology - Unit Cost and Activity Weighting - Provider 

#### 🔴 NEW - All scripts now migrated to UDAL and NCDR scripts removed
📝 National JAR methodology - Admitted Patient Care Episodes script - SUSLive (Provider) *- The SUS Live Episodes is not the source table used for the monthly published table, therefore will provide episode-level data and will remain within a 1% tolerance of the PAT tables.*   
📝 National JAR methodology - Admitted Patient Care Spells script - SUSLive (Provider)   
📝 National JAR methodology - Outpatient Attendance script - SUSLive (Provider)  

#### Commissioner Focus
📝 Modify scripts to use Pat_Commissioner or Der_Commissioner_codes and use CCG codes to pull Commissioner footprint, update where clause bring in local commissioner codes and update provider hieraches join to the commissioner hieraches table

### About the Scripts

💰 **Unit Cost and Activity Weighting** *- this has not been updated just yet M2 will be the release date of the 2324 reference costs, we currently do not have access to this data*
